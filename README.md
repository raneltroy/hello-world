Hello friend! My name is Ranel Troy Santos. I'm a student pharmacist at UCSF in San Francisco, CA. My mission in life is to be a man for others, by leading with integrity and compassion. 


I will fulfill my mission through pharmacy and health care. I think we can all agree that health care and pharmacy can be vastly improved in this country. I am determined to advocate for my patients and find innovative and effective ways to improve their health.

I am also determined to find the greatest beer in the world.

My contact information is listed on the website. I love discussing big ideas - send me a message so we can chat!

Troy
